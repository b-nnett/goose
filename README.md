# Goose - Local Companion for WHOOP Devices

**Alpha proof of concept. This build is for developers to evaluate whether a project of this scope is viable. It is not ready to use as an app for tracking personal health data yet.**

If you don't know what Xcode is, or how to build the Rust core, this build is not for you. Come back on 13 June 2026 for the first public beta on TestFlight.

This prototype targets WHOOP 5.0 and WHOOP 4.0. Other WHOOP generations are not supported in this build.

The app and backend have had very little attention put into performance. The app will lag, very considerably. Performance PRs are welcome, or you can wait until I address it in due course.

Goose is a local-first WHOOP data and health metrics project. The iOS app connects to WHOOP bands, routes packet data through the Goose Rust core, and turns that data into daily health, recovery, sleep, strain, stress, cardio, energy, coach, and debug views. An optional self-hosted server lets you persist decoded biometric streams outside the device.

Key Swift entry points:

- `GooseSwiftApp.swift`: app lifecycle and deep-link handling.
- `RootView.swift`: onboarding gate and global sync toast host.
- `AppShellView.swift`: tab shell and shared health store wiring.
- `GooseAppModel.swift`: app state, BLE ownership, lifecycle, and bridge summaries.
- `GooseBLEClient.swift`: Bluetooth scan/connect/sync logic.
- `GooseRustBridge.swift`: Swift wrapper around the Rust C bridge.
- `HealthView.swift` and `Health*` files: health dashboards, metric pages, trends, and sheets.
- `CoachView.swift` and `Coach*` files: coach UI and chat support.
- `MoreView.swift`: operational/debug/settings surfaces.

This is an active prototype. Because the data pipeline is still evolving, some metrics appear as empty or unavailable until the app has a source for them.

## Independence

Goose is an independent project and is not affiliated with WHOOP. This repository does not include or reference source code owned by WHOOP. The app communicates with WHOOP bands over Bluetooth using services and data exposed by the device, then parses and stores that local data through the Goose Rust core. Product names are used only to describe compatibility.

## Design Credit

The current health metric UI draws heavily from [Bevel](https://www.bevel.health/), especially the Sleep, Recovery, Strain, Stress, and trend-detail surfaces. Bevel is not affiliated with Goose; this credit is here because their product design has been a major visual reference.

## Current Scope

- SwiftUI app shell with Home, Health, Coach, and More tabs.
- Onboarding and persisted profile state.
- CoreBluetooth scan/connect flows for WHOOP 5.0 and WHOOP 4.0 devices.
- JSON-over-C bridge into the Goose Rust core.
- Self-hosted server (`server/`): FastAPI + TimescaleDB, Dockerized; supports both device generations via `device_generation` field.
- Automatic upload of decoded biometric data from iOS to server.
- Health metric surfaces for Sleep, Recovery, Strain, Stress, Cardio Load, Energy Bank, Health Monitor, Packet Inputs, Algorithms, References, and Calibration.
- HealthKit sleep import and workout write support.
- Coach surfaces that summarize local metrics and explain missing data.
- More/Debug operational surfaces for device state, capture, sync, algorithms, storage, privacy, and support.
- Workout Live Activity extension.

## Requirements

- macOS with Xcode installed.
- iOS 26 SDK and an iOS 26 capable simulator/device.
- Apple Developer signing configured for the `com.goose.swift` bundle identifier.
- Rust and Cargo for building the Goose Rust core from the committed `Rust/core` source.
- iOS Rust targets installed with `rustup`; see the Rust Core Bridge section below.
- Docker (for the self-hosted server — optional).

Built Rust `.a` archives are generated locally during Xcode builds and are not committed. Set `GOOSE_SKIP_RUST_CORE_BUILD=1` only when the matching local archive already exists for the active Xcode platform.

## Build

Clone the repository first:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tigercraft4/goose.git
cd goose
```

Open `GooseSwift.xcodeproj` in Xcode and build the `GooseSwift` scheme, or build from the command line.

Simulator build:

```sh
xcodebuild \
  -project GooseSwift.xcodeproj \
  -scheme GooseSwift \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17' \
  -derivedDataPath /tmp/goose-swift-deriveddata \
  build
```

Physical device build:

```sh
xcodebuild \
  -project GooseSwift.xcodeproj \
  -scheme GooseSwift \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'platform=iOS,id=<device-id>' \
  -derivedDataPath /tmp/goose-swift-deriveddata-device \
  -allowProvisioningUpdates \
  build
```

List connected devices:

```sh
xcrun devicectl list devices
```

## Reinstall On A Device

After a successful physical-device build, reinstall and launch:

```sh
xcrun devicectl device uninstall app \
  --device <device-id> \
  com.goose.swift

xcrun devicectl device install app \
  --device <device-id> \
  /tmp/goose-swift-deriveddata-device/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/GooseSwift.app

xcrun devicectl device process launch \
  --device <device-id> \
  --terminate-existing \
  com.goose.swift
```

## Self-Hosted Server

The `server/` directory contains an optional FastAPI + TimescaleDB backend. The iOS app works standalone without it.

```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env
# Set GOOSE_API_KEY and GOOSE_DB_PASSWORD in .env
docker compose up -d --build
```

Check it started: `curl -s localhost:8770/healthz` → `{"status":"ok"}`

Configure the server URL and Bearer token in the iOS app under More > Server Settings. See `server/README.md` for API details and the full list of environment variables.

## Rust Core Bridge

The Rust bridge source is committed in `Rust/core`. Do not commit built `.a`
archives; Xcode generates them locally through `Scripts/build_ios_rust.sh`.

Prerequisites:

- Xcode command line tools.
- Rust via `rustup`.
- iOS Rust targets:

```bash
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios aarch64-apple-ios-sim x86_64-apple-ios
```

`Scripts/build_ios_rust.sh` builds `Rust/core` for the active Xcode platform:

- `iphoneos` -> `aarch64-apple-ios`
- `iphonesimulator` on Apple Silicon -> `aarch64-apple-ios-sim`
- `iphonesimulator` on Intel -> `x86_64-apple-ios`

Outputs are staged into:

```text
Rust/iphoneos/libgoose_core.a
Rust/iphonesimulator/libgoose_core.a
```

The Swift target links `Rust/$(PLATFORM_NAME)/libgoose_core.a` and reads the C
bridge header from `Rust/core/include/goose_core_bridge.h`. The default Cargo
target directory is `build/rust-target/goose-core`, so Rust build products stay
outside the committed source tree.

Manual builds:

```bash
# Simulator on Apple Silicon
PLATFORM_NAME=iphonesimulator CURRENT_ARCH=arm64 Scripts/build_ios_rust.sh

# Physical iPhone
PLATFORM_NAME=iphoneos CURRENT_ARCH=arm64 Scripts/build_ios_rust.sh
```

You normally do not need to run these by hand; the Xcode build phase runs the
script before compiling Swift.

## Data And Privacy

- Metric views show empty, stale, or unavailable states when a source is missing.
- Metric rows and trend sheets show where values came from when that information is available.
- Raw packet payloads stay in debug/export flows rather than everyday health views.
- Coach responses use the same local metric summaries shown in the app.
- Health and fitness data is local by default. Any future backend or AI feature will need its own consent flow and privacy notes.

## Development Notes

- Prefer small, typed Swift models over displaying raw summary strings.
- Keep Home, Health, Coach, and More routes modular enough to work independently.
- Metric pages should still look polished when data is missing.
- Before installing to a device, run a simulator or device build and check that the Rust library target matches the destination platform.
