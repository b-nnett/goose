## Phase Details

### Phase 67: WHOOP 5.0 Protocol Fixes

**Goal**: WHOOP 5.0 users receive realtime metrics and full per-second historical data — the two silent protocol gaps (R22 type 0x10 unhandled, v18 historical frames silently discarded) are fixed in Rust with no Swift changes required
**Depends on**: Phase 65
**Requirements**: BLE5-01, BLE5-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. A WHOOP 5.0 device streaming R22 packets produces non-zero realtime HRV, HR, and recovery metrics in the Health tab (R22 type 0x10 parsed and routed)
  2. Historical sync for a WHOOP 5.0 device imports per-second rows into SQLite without duplicates (v18 decode + sequence_id dedup active)
  3. `cargo test -- protocol_tests` passes in full, including new round-trip tests for R22 type 0x10 and v18 per-second decode
  4. No Swift files are changed — the fix is entirely within `Rust/core/src/protocol.rs` and its test suite

**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

**Wave 1**

- [ ] 67-01-PLAN.md — BLE5-01: R22 realtime packet (type 0x10) parsing + R17/R22 same-second dedup (R22 priority)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1)*

- [ ] 67-02-PLAN.md — BLE5-02: v18 per-second historical decode + SQLite persistence + stale-clock 300s snap + EVENT type-48 timestamp bypass

### Phase 68: BLE Manager Refactor + Data Validator

**Goal**: Historical sync logic is decoupled from GooseBLEClient into a dedicated GooseBLEHistoricalManager, and a GooseBLEDataValidator struct gates structurally invalid BLE frames before they reach the Rust bridge
**Depends on**: Phase 67
**Requirements**: BLE5-03, BLE5-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. A `GooseBLEHistoricalManager` class exists and owns the historical sync state machine; `GooseBLEClient` delegates to it via a proxy computed property that preserves all existing call sites
  2. A `GooseDataValidator` (or `GooseBLEDataValidator`) struct exists and rejects frames that fail structural invariants (minimum length, non-nil device ID, non-empty payload) before the Rust bridge is called
  3. Invalid frames are counted in a debug counter visible in More > Debug and logged via OSLog without crashing
  4. All existing historical sync behaviour is preserved — no regression in sync correctness

**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

**Wave 1**

- [x] 68-01-PLAN.md — BLE5-03: extract GooseBLEHistoricalManager (final class, proxy computed vars preserve all call sites)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1)*

- [x] 68-02-PLAN.md — BLE5-04: GooseBLEDataValidator struct (structural invariants only) + invalidFrameCount in More > Debug

### Phase 69: Data Foundation

**Goal**: Four new SQLite tables (journal, workout, appleDaily, metricSeries) are migrated into the Rust store and a realtime strain accumulator publishes live strain during active workout sessions
**Depends on**: Phase 67
**Requirements**: DATA-01, DATA-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Schema version advances to v20; four new tables (journal, workout, appleDaily, metricSeries) are created on first launch after upgrade without data loss
  2. The strain tile on the workout screen updates at most every few seconds during an active session, driven by `GooseStrainAccumulator` receiving HR samples from `WhoopDataSignalPipeline`
  3. `cargo test` passes in full, including migration tests verifying the v19→v20 migration arm is idempotent
  4. Multiple concurrent GooseRustBridge instances writing to metricSeries produce no duplicate rows (idempotent insert pattern)

**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

**Wave 1** *(parallel — Rust and Swift are independent)*

- [x] 69-01-PLAN.md — DATA-01: schema v20 migration (4 tables) + 4 bridge upsert methods + migration tests
- [ ] 69-02-PLAN.md — DATA-02: GooseStrainAccumulator actor + GooseAppModel wiring (liveWorkoutStrain)

### Phase 70: Haptic Primitive + Breathe Screen

**Goal**: The app can command the WHOOP 5.0 strap to vibrate via BLE cmd 0x13, and the Breathe screen delivers a paced haptic session using that primitive
**Depends on**: Phase 65
**Requirements**: HAP-01, HAP-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. A `buzz(loops:)` method exists on `GooseBLEClient` (via a new `GooseBLEClient+Haptics.swift` extension file) and issues cmd 0x13 over the established command characteristic — verified by OSLog output showing the write
  2. The Breathe screen is accessible from the app, completes a full breath cycle (inhale/hold/exhale), and calls `buzz(loops:)` at each phase transition to pace the user via strap vibration
  3. The Breathe session can be started and stopped by the user; stopping mid-session does not leave the BLE command characteristic in an undefined state
  4. No buzz is attempted when no WHOOP device is connected — the UI shows an appropriate disabled state

**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

**Wave 1** *(parallel)*

- [x] 70-01-PLAN.md — HAP-01: GooseBLEClient+Haptics.swift with buzz(loops:) — fire-and-forget BLE cmd 0x13
- [ ] 70-02-PLAN.md — HAP-02: BreatheView.swift + MoreRoute.breathe navigation wiring + MoreDataStore updates

### Phase 71: Coach VOW + NoopApp Features + Notifications + HR Decimation

**Goal**: The Coach tab shows locally-computed contextual nudges, three NoopApp-derived features (Breathe UI access, Interval Timer, Metric Explorer) are reachable, iOS local notifications fire at the right moments, and the HR chart loads without lag on long sessions
**Depends on**: Phase 70
**Requirements**: FEAT-01, FEAT-02, FEAT-03, DATA-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. The Coach tab displays at least one VOW (Voice of WHOOP) nudge computed locally from bridge data — nudges are contextual (e.g. low recovery warning, high strain alert) and require no server call
  2. Breathe UI, Interval Timer, and Metric Explorer are each reachable from the app and functional
  3. A local notification fires after a detected sleep cycle completes, after a workout session is detected, and when WHOOP battery drops below 20% — all using the existing `UNUserNotificationCenter` permission granted in onboarding
  4. The HR chart for a session longer than 60 minutes renders without visible lag; the in-memory sample count is reduced via stride/LTTB decimation while local extrema are preserved

**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:

**Wave 1** *(parallel)*

- [ ] 71-01-PLAN.md — FEAT-01: Coach VOW card (CoachVOWNudge enum + CoachVOWCard view in CoachView.swift)
- [ ] 71-02-PLAN.md — DATA-04: HeartRateSeriesStore.decimatedSamples + migrate 4 HealthDataStore+* call sites

**Wave 2** *(parallel — no dependency on Wave 1)*

- [ ] 71-03-PLAN.md — FEAT-02: IntervalTimerView + MetricExplorerView + MoreRoute wiring (5 files)
- [ ] 71-04-PLAN.md — FEAT-03: NotificationScheduler actor + 3 scheduling sites (sleep / workout / battery)

### Phase 72: Screens on New Foundation + Service Layer

**Goal**: Three new SwiftUI screens (Stress/ANS view, Trends dashboard, Manual Workout Entry sheet) are delivered on the Phase 69 data tables, and GooseBLEClient/GooseRustBridge/HealthDataStore gain Swift protocols with corresponding mocks in the test target
**Depends on**: Phase 69
**Requirements**: DATA-03, ARCH-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. A Stress/ANS view is accessible and shows ANS-derived tiles (HRV, RHR, stress level) populated from bridge data
  2. A Trends dashboard shows long-range metric history (≥7 days) sourced from the metricSeries table added in Phase 69
  3. A Manual Workout Entry sheet allows the user to log a workout with sport tag, duration, and perceived effort — the entry is persisted to the workout table
  4. `GooseBLEManaging`, `GooseRustBridging`, and `HealthDataStoring` protocols exist; mock implementations exist in the test target; at least 2 unit tests use the mocks and pass with `cargo test` or Swift test runner

**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 73: Smart Alarm + Wake-Window Engine

**Goal**: The user can schedule a single-shot strap vibration alarm at a fixed time (HAP-03), and the wake-window engine fires the alarm at the lightest-sleep moment within the user's alarm window (HAP-04, RE-gated)
**Depends on**: Phase 70
**Requirements**: HAP-03, HAP-04
**Note**: HAP-04 is RE-gated — implementation of the wake-window engine must not begin until BTSnoop capture of `STRAP_DRIVEN_ALARM_EXECUTED` and Ghidra decompilation of `SetAlarmInfoCommandPacketRev4` are both completed and documented in `.planning/research/whoop-re/`
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. The Sleep Coach screen shows an alarm arm/cancel control; arming it schedules a single-shot vibration at the user-specified time via `AlarmCommandKind` + `writeAlarmCommand()` + `buzz(loops:)` confirmation
  2. Cancelling a scheduled alarm disarms it and updates the UI to reflect the cancelled state
  3. (HAP-04 — RE-gated) `GooseWakeWindowManager` exists and monitors sleep state via bridge polling; it fires `buzz(loops:)` at the lightest-sleep moment within the user's alarm window
  4. (HAP-04 — RE-gated) The wake-window wire format is derived from confirmed `SetAlarmInfoCommandPacketRev4` field layout — no speculative byte assignments

**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

Promoted to Phase 18: Coach Multi-Provider.

#### Archived phase 60 — Band-First Sync

**Goal:** Align Goose's BLE sync architecture with the WHOOP app's band-first model, eliminating the need for continuous overnight BLE capture. The band stores data onboard; the app fetches it opportunistically on foreground and via silent push, exactly as WHOOP does.

**Depends on:** Phase 59
**Plans:** 1/2 plans executed
Plans:
**Wave 1**

- [x] 60-01-PLAN.md — Delete overnight guard subsystem core (3 files + GooseAppModel state + overnight struct types)
- [x] 60-02-PLAN.md — Add band-first sync: BandFirstSync.swift (foreground trigger + BGAppRefreshTask handler), BGTask registration, Info.plist keys

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*

- [x] 60-03-PLAN.md — Wire foreground trigger + clean secondary overnight references; build clean (wave 2)

#### Archived phase 61 — BLE Bonding State Machine

**Goal:** Replace the implicit OS bonding path with a formal bonding manager that tracks bond state through distinct steps, matching the `WHPBLEBondingManager` pattern from WHOOP (NotStarted → Started → Subscribed → Completed/Cancelled).

**Depends on:** Phase 60
**Requirements:** BLE-BOND-01
**WHOOP reference:** `WHPBLEBondingManager`, `WHPBLEBondingManagerProtocol`, states: `WHPBLEBondingNotStartedState`, `WHPBLEBondingStartedState`, `WHPBLEBondingSubscribedState`, `WHPBLEBondingCompletedState`, `WHPBLEBondingCancelledState`
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. A `GooseBLEBondingManager` type exists with the 5 formal states; bonding progress is observable from `GooseAppModel`
2. On BT reset or iOS reboot, the app detects bond loss, re-enters the bonding flow, and reconnects without user action
3. Bonding state is persisted across app restarts so the app can resume from the last known state
4. The existing string-based `connectionState` is replaced with the formal state machine output for the bonding portion

**Plans:** 3/3 plans complete
Plans:

**Wave 1**

- [x] 61-01-PLAN.md — Foundation: GooseBLEBondingState enum + GooseBLEBondingManager class + localized strings

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1)*

- [x] 61-02-PLAN.md — Integration: wire bonding manager into GooseBLEClient/delegate/commands + GooseAppModel observability + bond-loss detection

**Wave 3** *(blocked on Wave 2)*

- [x] 61-03-PLAN.md — Human-verify checkpoint: bond-loss recovery + persistence across restart

---

#### Archived phase 62 — Upload Watermark per Sensor

**Goal:** Track the last successfully uploaded timestamp per data type (raw frames, processed metrics) so restarts and partial uploads never re-send data already in TimescaleDB, matching WHOOP's `WHPStrapLatestUploadedMetricDateKey` / per-sensor high-water-mark pattern.

**Depends on:** Phase 61
**Requirements:** UPLOAD-WM-01
**WHOOP reference:** `WHPStrapLatestUploadedMetricDateKey`, `WHPStrapHighWaterMarkDateKey`, `WatermarksInteractor`, `StoredWatermarksAtHistoryComplete`, watermark shape `[Int: Date]` keyed by revision
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. A watermark is persisted (UserDefaults or SQLite) for each upload type (raw frames, daily metrics) and updated atomically on upload success
2. After a crash mid-upload, the next launch resumes from the watermark — no duplicate rows appear in TimescaleDB
3. The server-side `POST /v1/ingest-frames` endpoint rejects (or deduplicates) frames below the committed watermark
4. A reset path exists (`clearAllWatermarks`) for logout / device swap

**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete

- [x] 62-01-PLAN.md — Create GooseUploadWatermark store (UserDefaults, per-type Date, clearAllWatermarks)
- [x] 62-02-PLAN.md — Wire watermark into upload pipeline (gated sinceTimestamp, atomic write on 2xx, reset path)

---

#### Archived phase 63 — Network Monitor & Upload Gating

**Goal:** Gate all outbound uploads on network reachability, matching WHOOP's `WHPNetworkMonitor` pattern, and implement exponential-backoff retry so uploads fail visibly rather than silently when offline.

**Depends on:** Phase 62
**Requirements:** NET-MON-01
**WHOOP reference:** `WHPNetworkMonitor`, `WHPAccountCanUploadDataStatusChanged` notification (WHOOP also gates on account authorisation)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. A `GooseNetworkMonitor` wraps `NWPathMonitor` and publishes a `isReachable: Bool` to `GooseAppModel`
2. Upload is not attempted when `isReachable == false`; queued work is retried automatically when connectivity returns
3. Upload failures due to server error (5xx) use exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, max 60s) with a visible error state in the UI
4. Upload is gated on a non-empty device token (APNs registration must have succeeded at least once)

**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete
Plans:

**Wave 1**

- [x] 63-01-PLAN.md — Create GooseNetworkMonitor (NWPathMonitor wrapper) + wire isNetworkReachable into GooseAppModel + register in project.pbxproj

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1)*

- [x] 63-02-PLAN.md — Reachability + APNs-token upload gating, connectivity-return retry, 5xx exponential backoff (1/2/4s, max 60s) with visible error state, APNs registration AppDelegate

---

#### Archived phase 64 — HR Data Sanitizer

**Goal:** Add a Swift-side heart rate sanitization step between raw BLE notification bytes and `HeartRateSeriesStore`, matching WHOOP's `WHPHeartRateDataSanitizer`, to suppress physiologically impossible spikes before they reach the UI or Rust algorithms.

**Depends on:** Phase 60
**Requirements:** HR-SAN-01
**WHOOP reference:** `WHPHeartRateDataSanitizer`, `WHPHeartRateDecimator2` (decimation is a stretch goal)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. A `GooseHRSanitizer` type filters HR samples outside a configurable valid range (e.g. 25–220 BPM) before they enter `HeartRateSeriesStore`
2. Spike samples are logged (OSLog) and counted in a debug counter visible in More > Debug
3. The live HR display never shows a value outside the valid range during normal wear
4. Sanitizer thresholds are constants (`static let`) not hard-coded literals

**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete
Plans:

**Wave 1**

- [x] 64-01-PLAN.md — GooseHRSanitizer (struct + static let 25/220 thresholds), wire at recordLiveHeartRate chokepoint to gate liveHeartRateBPM + HeartRateSeriesStore, hrSpikeCount + More > Debug counter, build clean

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1)*

- [x] 64-02-PLAN.md — Human-verify checkpoint: live HR stays in-range during normal wear + debug spike counter increments

---

#### Archived phase 65 — Generic BLE State Machine

**Goal:** Extract a lightweight reusable `StateMachine<State, Event>` type (matching `WHPStateMachine` + `WHPStateMachineState` + `WHPStateMachineEventDefinition`) and migrate the BLE connection and bonding state into it, replacing the ad-hoc string status scattered across `GooseBLEClient`.

**Depends on:** Phase 61
**Requirements:** SM-01
**WHOOP reference:** `WHPStateMachine`, `WHPStateMachineState`, `WHPStateMachineEventDefinition`
**Note:** Previously flagged as over-engineering for the codebase's current size — added at user request. Scope is deliberately minimal: one generic type + migration of BLE connection/bonding states only. No broader adoption beyond BLE layer unless a future phase warrants it.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. A `StateMachine<State: Hashable, Event>` struct exists in `GooseBLETypes.swift` or a new `GooseStateMachine.swift`
2. BLE connection states (from Phase 61's bonding manager + existing connection states) are expressed as `StateMachine` instances
3. Invalid state transitions are asserted in DEBUG builds; in RELEASE they are no-ops that log an OSLog error
4. No reduction in observable behaviour — existing UI reflecting connection state continues to work

#### Archived phase 66 — Cap Sense / On-Wrist Detection

**Goal:** Identify the GATT characteristic for WHOOP's capacitive skin-contact sensor (cap sense) via Ghidra and implement on-wrist detection in Goose, matching `WHPWhoopStrapCapSenseSuccessNotification` / `CapSenseFailed`, so physiological data is only trusted when the band is being worn.

**Depends on:** Phase 60
**Requirements:** CAPSENSE-01
**WHOOP reference:** `WHPWhoopStrapCapSenseSuccessNotification`, `WHPWhoopStrapCapSenseFailed`, `WHPWhoopStrapOnWrist`, `WHPWhoopStrapOffWrist`, `WHPWhoopStrapSensorsStatusLiveChangedNotification`
**Note:** GATT characteristic UUID for cap sense is not yet identified — this phase begins with a Ghidra investigation step. If the characteristic cannot be identified from the binary, the phase is blocked and deferred.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. The cap sense GATT characteristic UUID is identified via Ghidra static analysis and documented in `.planning/research/whoop-re/`
2. `GooseBLEClient` subscribes to the cap sense characteristic and publishes `isOnWrist: Bool` to `GooseAppModel`
3. HR and HRV samples acquired while `isOnWrist == false` are flagged in SQLite (`on_wrist = 0`) and excluded from strain/recovery computations
4. The Device Status Card (Phase 53) shows an off-wrist indicator when detected
